- **Multi-page folding card** with realistic paper texture
- **Organic shapes and curves** - no boring rectangles
- **Hand-pressed flowers** and watercolor effects
- **Decorative ribbon** with knot wrapping around the card
- **Canvas particle effects** for ambient floating golden particles
- **Laser-cut borders** and embossed textures

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Real wedding invitations are **tactile, dimensional, and precious**. This design captures that **physicality** digitally through:

1. **No rectangles** - Curves, organic shapes, ornamental details
2. **Layered depth** - Multiple shadows, 3D transforms, overlays
3. **Physical metaphors** - Wax seal, envelope, folding pages
4. **Hand-crafted feel** - Textures, pressed flowers, imperfections
5. **Ceremonial opening** - Sequential reveal builds anticipation
